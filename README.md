# aoc-cli

Forked from [scarvalhojr](https://github.com/scarvalhojr).

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) command-line tool.

Read Advent of Code puzzle descriptions, download puzzle input, submit answers
and check if they are correct, all from the comfort of your terminal.

## Features

- Validate arguments (year, day, part) and check if puzzle is unlocked.
- Infer puzzle day when possible (last unlocked puzzle during Advent of Code
  month).
- If year is not provided, it is assumed to be the current or the last Advent of
  Code event.
- Load Advent of Code session cookie from a file.

## Installation

### Compile from source

- Install a recent version of Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or update
it with:
```
# rustup update
```

`aoc-cli` relies on [openssl-sys](https://crates.io/crates/openssl-sys), which
requires OpenSSL libraries and headers for compiling it. On Linux, you need
to install a package with OpenSSL development headers such as `libssl-dev` or
`openssl-devel`.

- Install `aoc-cli`:

```
git clone https://github.com/tectrixer/aoc-cli
cargo install --path .
```
## Session cookie

Different Advent of Code users get different puzzle input. To download your
input and submit your answer, you need an adventofcode.com session cookie. To
obtain your session cookie, login to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website and inspect the `session`
value of the cookie that gets stored in your browser. Put the session number (a
long hex string) in a file called `.adventofcode.session` in your home
directory. This file should only contain your session number, in a single line.

comfort of your terminal:

You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding
pass! You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are
busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.
...
```

### Download puzzle input

Download input for today's puzzle and save it to a file named "input" on the
current directory:

```
# aoc download

Loaded session cookie from "/home/user/.adventofcode.session".
Downloading input for day 5, 2020...
Saving puzzle input to "input"...
Done!
```

### Submit puzzle answers

Submit the answer to part 1 of today's puzzle (in this example, the answer is
999):

```
# aoc submit 1 999

Loaded session cookie from "/home/user/.adventofcode.session".
Submitting answer for part 1, day 5, 2020...

That's the right answer! You are one gold star closer to saving your vacation. [[Continue to Part Two]][1]

[1] /2020/day/5#part2
```

### Command abbreviations

Any prefix of a command can be used instead of the full command name. For instance:
- Instead of `aoc read`, type `aoc r`, `aoc re` or `aoc rea`.
- Instead of `aoc download`, type `aoc d`, `aoc do`, `aoc dow`, `aoc down`, etc.
- Instead of `aoc submit`, type `aoc s`, `aoc su`, `aoc sub`, etc.

### More examples

Download the input from a previous day (assumes the current year):

```
# aoc download --day 1

Loaded session cookie from "/home/user/.adventofcode.session".
Downloading input for day 1, 2020...
Saving puzzle input to "input"...
Done!
```

Download the input from a previous year and save it to a file with a given
name:

```
# aoc download --year 2015 --day 1 --file /home/user/aoc/2015/1/input
```

An attempt to download the input of a puzzle that is still locked fails
(puzzles unlock every day between 1st and 25th of December at midnight
EST/UTC-5):

```
# aoc download --year 2030 --day 25

Loaded session cookie from "/home/user/.adventofcode.session".
Error: Puzzle 25 of 2030 is still locked.
```

Submit the answer to a previous year:
```
# aoc s 1 999 -y 2015 -d 1
```

Specify path to session cookie file:
```
# aoc download --session /tmp/.aoc.session
```
